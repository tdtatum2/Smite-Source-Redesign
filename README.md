# Smite-Source-Redesign

A Front-End Web Development project that centered on finding a website to redesign. I chose a game that helps players of a popular game, Smite, learn more about the characters and game systems. My goal was to modernize the design and make the UI more user friendly.



# Update (4/1/2023)
The website has since been updated to a much more modern design, but the goals of the initial project still stand. Although, there was a much better way to modularize the application and avoid the insane amount of separate HTML files :)
